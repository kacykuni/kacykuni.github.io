## Takeaways from Software Engineering
Although this course primarily focuses on web applications, I have learned a lot more than implementing frontend and backend functionality. I believe the most important software engineering lessons that I will benefit the most from in the future are coding standards and ethics in software engineering. These two issues span further than just in software engineering and are vital in many aspects because they exist outside of web development too. While they are essential for web development as well, I believe that I will carry the knowledge of what I learned about these two topics into my future jobs. 

## Coding Standards
From what I have learned, coding standards are best described as the unwritten rules and guidelines that demonstrate how code should be written and formatted in order to improve readability, consistency, and reusability. By following these standards, it ensures that code wll be easier to review, debug, and provide a smoother handoff to other programmers, teammembers, and organizations. Since without these guidelines, everyone would struggle to read and understand each other's code, which would increase the amount of bugs and errors because it would make them that much more difficult to locate. Following these guidelines greatly improved the quality and efficiency of my final group project since we all agreed upon following these guidelines. This collaboration of writing clean code helped me understand and improve on reading and understanding code. Although it felt very technical at first, it has proved to be very useful and the constant repetition of writing code this way made it much easier as time went on. 

## Ethics in Software Engineering
Ethics in software engineering is best explained as the responsibility that all developers must have to create software and web applications that are proven to be safe and secure, while avoiding misuse of these responsibilities. Ethics exists in everything, but just beyond web applications in terms of software engineering, it is one of the most important things to learn early on as a developer because it can cause real harm in real world problems. Examples of a few ethical issues can be respecting user privacy, which means only collecting data that is necessary, while also protecting user data for safety and trust of the user. Honesty and transparency is also an important ethical issue because it’s important not to misrepresent what your software does and is capable of, especially when it may have flaws. These are just a few examples of how important respecting these ethical issues are because it makes me think very carefully about how easily people can be negatively affected by a simple web application, software, program, etc. These ethical issues are a responsibility that all software engineers must uphold in all projects, not just one. 

## Wrap-Up
These key topics that I have learned in this software engineering course, have taught me how to be accountable for the quality of my code because of the possible impact it can have on others. Ethical issues and coding standards can be applied to all software projects because they are connected with one another. Following poor coding standards can lead to more errors and bugs, which can lead to security issues, insecure code, and unprotected data.
