## Is Learning TypeScript Difficult?

As a complete newbie to the programming language TypeScript, I will say it is difficult. My only experience with programming so far has been with Java and C++, which I found difficult as well. I certainly believe that my struggles have been due to the fact that access to help over the internet has been so easy. I am sad to say that the lack of practice has affected my learnings. I started learning Java in 2023, C++ in 2024, and now Typescript, JavaScript, HTML, and ES6 in 2025. I would consider that I spend a short amount of time learning Java and C++ and the lack of practice has made it difficult to remember what I had learned from one or two years ago. 

As I went through learning TypeScript on FreeCodeCamp, I definitely found it to be more interesting and easier because TypeScript has type inference. Although I do still find it difficult to implement ES6 into my WODs and practice WODs because it is still a very new concept to me as well. I believe that I still have a lot to learn and need to do a lot more practice to be comfortable writing TypeScript and appreciate its simplicity from a software engineering perspective.

I definitely appreciate this style of learning and am still finding ways to better my experiences with this different style of teaching. The practice WODs are very useful and in class practice WODs as well. It forces you to work efficiently and think more proactively as the timer ticks but without the depressing pressure of failing if you don't succeed on the first attempt. I found out that the practice that it provides it crucial for the in-class graded WODs because it just prepares you and hopefully with time, will desensitize the timer as it ticks down so that all of my focus is on completing all the requirements and not wasting time looking at the clock. The graded WODs are a bit stressful but it already seems like a very beneficial way of learning.
