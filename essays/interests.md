## What is Software Engineering
Prior to taking Software Engineering, I did not know the difference between Software Engineer, Programmer, and Computer Scientist. Although since then, I have learned that a Software Engineer is a professional that they are compared to the architects of programming. By applying engineering principles to design, develop, test functionality, and maintain software security of softwares and applications. The experiences I have learned so far has shown me why professional connections are so important within all fields of computer science because all projects need collaboration and teamwork to build complex programs or maintain high security systems. 

## My Introduction to ICS
My journey that has led me to take an interest into ICS began with my experiences in Robotics. In highschool I was shown the importances of collaboration, problem-solving, and creativity. Although I was on the mechanical team which dealt with machining all the external parts of the robot, I had always thought it was interesting that behind the robots every move is software and one simple bug can neutralize it. This introduction into the world of computer science has led me to choose to be an ICS major because there are so many options to choose from. For example, majoring in accounting means you want to be an accountant, majoring in electrical engineering means you want to be an electrical engineer, and so on. In contrast, as a major in ICS I could choose to be a data scientist, web developer, game developer, cyber security specialist, database administrator, and etc. It almost feels like the options are endless. 

## My Future as an ICS Major
Having to be able to have so many different options is what keeps me intrigued. I can choose to develop any skills I want on my own time and upload them into my professional porfolio to be shown off to future employers. This sounds like big dreams when I still consider myself to be a begineer in computer science and software engineering, which is why the experiences I hope to gain in software engineering is comprised of learning new programming languages, system and software design, working on group projects that led to real-world applications, and internship and research opportunities that will help me with my future. Teamwork and collaboration skills, problem-solving, project and time management, and communication skills is all very important features that I know is crutial for a professional. Therefore it is my goal to really hone in onto these skills and experiences so I can have a bright future as an ICS major.
