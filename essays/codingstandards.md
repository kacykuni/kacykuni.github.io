For this final project in my ICS 111 class we were tasked to create a shopping cart application with a graphical user interface using Java Swing. This program allowed users to add items from a fixed drop down list of categories and items, add different quantities, view their cart, and calculate their total with tax included.

This was my first time working with GUI programming, it was very interesting and fun to be able to play with the different components like JFrame, JPanel, JList, and JOptionPane to create small or big interactive windows and buttons. This was a huge shift than working with user input and arguments. 

Overall, the project gave me a basic understanding of how GUIs are built and how complex coding must be on a larger scale with applications that I use everyday. It was definitely a challenging project for someone like me as a beginner programmer at the time, but it showed me how programming can create real and interactive applications. 

Here is some code that illustrates how I used graphical user interface in my programming:
