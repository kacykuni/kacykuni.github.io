## Why is it important to ask questions the 'smart' way?

Eric Raymond's guidelines about asking questions the smart way demonstrates that how you present your problem, be respectful, grammar and spelling, and follow up, can affect your chances of getting useful and respectful answers from experts. Demonstrating the effort that you have tried to solve a problem, finding the appropriate place for asking questions, detail, politeness, and following up will result in more people to wanting to help you come to a solution. In recent years, I feel that some people may forget that they are asking real people for help, therefore these factors matter when asking a question. 

## Example of a smart question


```
Q: Celery task called inside another task always goes to default queue even with queue specified



I’m running Celery with Django and Celery Beat. Celery Beat triggers an outer task every 30 minutes, and inside that task I enqueue another task per item. Both tasks are decorated to use the same custom queue, but the inner task still lands in the default queue.

from celery import shared_task
from django.db import transaction

@shared_task(queue="outer_queue")
def sync_all_items():
    """
    This outer task is triggered by Celery Beat every 30 minutes.
    It scans the DB for outdated items and enqueues a per-item task.
    """
    items = Item.objects.find_outdated_items()
    for item in items:
        # I expect this to enqueue on outer_queue as well
        process_item.apply_async_on_commit(args=(item.pk,))  


@shared_task(queue="outer_queue")
def process_item(item_id):
    do_some_processing(item_id=item_id)

Celery beat config:

CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE = {
    "sync_all_items": {
        "task": "myapp.tasks.sync_all_items",
        "schedule": crontab(minute="*/30"),
        # Beat is explicitly sending the outer task to outer_queue
        "options": {"queue": "outer_queue"},
    }
}

But, when I run the process_item task manually e.g. in the Django view, it respect the decorator and lands in expected queue.

I’ve tried:

    Adding queue='outer_queue' to apply_async_on_commit

    Calling process_item.delay(item.pk) instead

    Using .apply_async(args=[item.pk], queue='outer_queue') inside transaction.on_commit

But no matter what, the inner tasks still show up in the default queue.

```

In this example the asker clearly stated what program he is using and the issues that he is having. They provide their code directly into the question to give more context with the trouble they are having and provide the efforts they have already tried in order to fix the problem which has led them to ask other people on StackOverflow because they seem to have hit a wall trying to solve it themselves. The grammar mistakes in their question is very limited which adds to the clarity of their question which helps their question more understandable than those with type-o's. 


## Not smart question

While I don't believe that there is such a thing as a 'stupid' question. I do believe that the way you present your question and yourself can definitely affect the answers that you will receive.

```
Q: reconnection issue in WhiskeySockets / Baileys

im using "@whiskeysockets/baileys": "^6.7.18", and when i connect using qr code and log in, all the event emmiter works fine, i store my auth state in db to reconnect again.

if i scan and log in my account call makwascoket, every thing works fine, after some time / whenever my sever restarts and i reconnect with my auth state without scanning qr all the events does not work expect creds.update event. im using calling the connect function both time, where my socket is stored with makwwasock function.

im able to use all events after reconnecting to bailys, but this not working

```

In this example, it is clear that there are many grammatical errors and the effort to ask the question is not present. Since I am only a beginner in the concepts of software engineering and computer science, I do not understand the question they are asking, but I have found myself not wanting to attempt to understand the question presented because it seems to have been written in a lazy manner. I would assume that experts feel the same when coming across a question presented this way as well. 

## Conclusion

In a world where technology is advancing rapidly, it has become so easy to ask AI or search on the internet for the answer to many of the problems that we ask. Then when that fails and we must seek out help from others, we still present many of our questions in the same way like we are talking to a computer. It has been so easy to forget to ask questions respectfully and provide all the context and help to make answering our questions easier. This is why it is important to ask questions the 'smart' way because in my example above, there were no answers provided for their question, unlike the smart question example.
