summary: "Extra Credit project from ICS 111 to create a Sudoku Game but with modified rules, showcasing what we had learned so far."
---

This projects features a custom Sudoku-inspired game built for an Extra Credit ICS 111 assignment. This version uses different rules which reflected what we were currently learning at the time with interfaces, functions, user input, arrays, and etc. This experiemental Sudoku-inspired game was built as a learning exercise in ICS 111, but was a fun activity to explore how game mechanics can be adapted within simple code using the Intellij IDE. 
This provided me with insight and experience with handling user input, validating game rules, and structuring code to adapt in a way to reflect my current learning.

This is exactly how it is demonstrated to users after they finished solving the Sudoku within the IDE. There was functions and various classes for solving the Sudoku game, radnomizing each game, pausing & resuming during the game, and etc. It was definitely a fun experience in ICS 111.
